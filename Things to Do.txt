Technical Skyblock

##Map description
The original skyblock experience but with generating structures and the infinite void, all in vanilla minecraft with datapacks.
A guidebook is present to help with any information you need to complete every advancement. 
Description here (200 character max)  

##What do you love the most about your submission?
That this world generation is possible using just a datapack. I haven't seen anyone else use the custom world generation datapack setups (It was difficult to find proper documentation to actually make it!).
